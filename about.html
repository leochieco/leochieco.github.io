		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>
			I have always worked in the industrial automation sector, holding both technical and managerial roles and building a solid, multidisciplinary, and cross-functional experience.<BR>
			My natural versatility has allowed me to continuously expand my skills, ranging from computer vision and robotics to automatic control systems and electronics,
			while also embracing managerial areas such as project management and the coordination of funded research projects.<BR>
			Since my youth, I have been deeply fascinated by both analog and digital electronics. After earning a technical diploma in computer science, I went on to complete a degree in electronic engineering, combining my passion for electronics with a rigorous engineering education.<BR>
			In recent years, I have also been actively involved in projects related to the energy transition and sustainable mobility, contributing to the development of innovative and technologically advanced solutions in these strategic fields.<BR>
